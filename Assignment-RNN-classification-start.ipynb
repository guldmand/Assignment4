         "I had previously tried the Red Sandalwood soap and preshave, as well as the Green soap and preshave. I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself. I found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other Proraso soaps, which is to say that you'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.\n\nThe Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil. A somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. I have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the Proraso Green pre-shave. I apply the pre-shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking (just a few minutes), then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing. You may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go, but this stuff, when properly hydrated, is slick. All but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff. I was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself. With a safety razor and a good blade, the stubble comes off almost like magic. I was just able to perform my closest-ever shave with this tactic. Highly recommended.\n\nAssociated gear: Parker 99R safety razor; Boker Tree Brand straight razor; Escali Badger Hair brush; Proraso Green pre-shave.",

I have quite a selection in the oxblood/deep red/wine/reddish purple family, including glitters, cremes, shimmers, etc.  So I expected to love the color of this even before I bought it!\n\nI find the color in the bottle looks pretty similar to the color you see when it dries (and also to the image on the screen on the computer I'm currently using).  So you know what you'll be getting.  I'd say this had cool/purplish undertones for a red, it's really more of a wine color.  It has a subtle shimmer and looks really nice with a high-shine topcoat (I used one from Seche Vite).\n\nThis went on more smoothly than most polishes I've used lately (over an OPI base coat).  It dried quickly.  I used two coats to get it fully opaque, but depending on your preferences, you might be able to get by with one thick coat.  I got only one tiny bubble that you can hardly even see (I've had much worse bubbling problems with other polishes).  So far, I don't have any shrinking or chips although that might change when I clean house later tonight.  But about 18 hours after application, it still looks nearly perfect.  I'd say this was one of the better-performing Zoya polishes I've used in that regard.  (I have quite a few of them.)",

More importantly for me, it doesn't leave my hair oily looking like many styling products do by the end of the day. The paste itself is thick and non-greasy.

I thought it would be a solid pink, so when it arrived and I saw how sheer it really was, I was at first disappointed. But!! After using it, it made THE perfect go-with-anything neutral nail. I have very pink nail beds anyway, so this looked like I'd gotten a clear polish  manicure and just have naturally pretty nail beds. I used Lomasi top and base coats because that is what I have (and like). This works just fine with the Lomasi brand. I also use an LED light and 30 seconds for each color coat. The Shellac smells like regular polish until cured, which was amusing to me. Definitely stinkier than Gelish or other brands.\n\nI have to say that Shellac and Lomasi rank RIGHT UP THERE for me, in so many areas. The brushes in them are great! They are easy to use, and they make the tiny window of time I have to do my nails, worthwhile. The Shellac seems to cure thicker, harder, and have a more durable finish than Gelish or Red Carpet. I am very pleased at how my nails look when I've used this product and will be buying more Shellac colors.\n\nI couldn't be happier with my gel nail experience, using the Shellac products. I have ZERO complaints about them, which is pretty amazing if you have read my Gelish review and see how much I gripe about the various products. I felt that the Shellac product was a professional quality item, and I wouldn't hesitate to buy other Shellac items nor would I hesitate to recommend them to anyone! They are worth the price, for the total satisfaction they deliver. When you figure that your TIME is valuable, this really factors into the value of this product.",

As a mass produced soap it's actually really nice. It loads well, though I will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones. The scent is nice and has some staying power. The slickness is about average I would say and it provides decent cushion. Is this the best soap in the world? Nope. Is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point? Absolutely. One of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave. Not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from Proraso. This is their sensitive skin formula (and I have some sensitive skin.) Let me just say a preshave is a must. I use an oil but you could use theirs as well. A good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better. without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti-inflammatory properties.",

Both are more of a \"croap\" (cross between hard cream & soap) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap. It lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush & the \"Marco method\" (if you're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather, google it - you won't regret it), and provides a good, close, irritation-free shave. I lather in the plastic Proraso bowl directly on the soap, then go straight to leg. I have also done a separate bowl lather with this, and it worked nicely. After use I leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat (I shave in the shower & store my soap there, so there's a lot of water) and then store it with the lid on. The white has a slight menthol feel, but considerably less than the green. In my opinion, the white has a light scent of roses & fresh cut grass. It's very light and clean, and I think it could be considered the most \"feminine\" between the green, red & white Proraso soaps. I had issues with irritation from the red Proraso (disappointing, since I loved the scent), but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me.

It actually has a pleasant smell. If you apply more that the directed amount you are left with a residue, but if you apply a thin layer like the directions state you should use then it goes on smoothly without staining clothes or any residue. It also works well as an overall body lotion to moisturize your skin, anywhere other than your belly. I haven't noticed any stretch marks.\n\nI really enjoy the pump on the Bust Firming Serum more than the squeeze tubes of Mustela's other products. This serum has no smell and I like the orange color. It feels like it's working from the tightness the serum leaves on my skin. A small amount goes a long way and it doesn't feel sticky. It feels quite smooth.

It's easy to get precisely the amount you want and no more.  This is especially important to me given the price point.  The cream at first seems a little runny, but it's easy to apply.  Although it seems runny, it feels thick once applied.  When applied, it feels like a protective layer is on my skin.  My skin feels moist and soft after applying this lotion.\n\nThe downside for me is that it feels a little too oily and the scent is very strong.  I am concerned that this cream will end up clogging my pores, so I am using it sparingly and on areas of my face that aren't prone to break outs.  The second issue I have with this product is that the smell is very strong.  I am sensitive to scents and the aroma of this product can be overwhelming.

I was also considering the T3 dryer which was significantly more.\n\nI was very impressed with this one! I have very thick hair which is fine and used to take me about 20-30 minutes to dry. In 10 minutes with this dryer my hair was completely dry! It seems to run a little quieter than my old Conair and is a little smaller. The buttons are stiff enough that a little bump won't change the setting and I found the grip to be comfortable. On mine, the nozzle stayed on perfectly. It's got a long cord which could be convenient. The low heat setting does a great job of drying, and the hot setting DOES get pretty hot.

But I love everything else. It is quiet (for a blow dryer) it has a low pitched hum that doesn't hurt my ears. It is so powerful. I can't imagine using this one the highest setting. I love how many different settings it has! There are 5 fan speeds indicated by the digital reader turning colors as you push them up or down. There are many heat settings the hottest one would burn your hand. The cool shot doesn't have to be held down, leaving you free to leave it on as long as you want and maneuvering in different ways. I love all the attachments, the defuser is smaller and doesn't take up so much space in my drawer.

I was pretty excited to try this mud intensive hand cream.  Having tried MANY creams I would rate this one average. I feel you can get similar moisture with store bought hand creams like Aveeno for a dramatically decreased price.  It has a rather strong scent and I did notice that it left a smooth, waxy sheen on my skin.  But I wash my hands a lot for work and my sign of a good cream is that is gives me a good protective coat that penetrates my skin.  Sadly after after the first wash most of it had come off even after letting it soak prior to washing for 30 min.  A good hand cream for dry hand for me will still retain some moisture even after the third hand wash.  I don't think there is anything wrong with this hand cream just that it doesn't fulfill my requirements of hand moisture.  It isn't bad but for the price I expected something more spectacular.",
